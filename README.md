# Second Assignment

## Resources

- description of the youtube dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new
- pandas cheat sheet: https://pandas.pydata.org/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf
- formulas for statistics: http://www.mtreiber.de/statistikFormelnTabellen/statistikFormelsammlung.pdf
- interactive challenges for learning pandas: https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas

## ToDo

- Solve the programming exercises listed in [`EXERCISES.md`](/EXERCISES.md).
- Test your code locally by running `python -m pytest --tb=line` in the command line/ anaconda terminal from the root directory of this repository.
- Answer the report questions inside [`REPORT.md`](/REPORT.md) (**max 1-3 sentence per question!**).

## General remarks

- You earn points by solving exercises and by writing a short report. In total, you can make more than 100 points but for the best grade you only need 100 points. The rest counts as a bonus.
- Exercises that do not pass the provided test cases give zero points. **Please make sure that you don't have any [syntax errors](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Errors#Syntax_errors) in your code.**
- Don't change the file structure of the repository (e.g., by adding or deleting files). **Only work within the provided exercise files in the `exercises` folder.**
- Help for the assignment will be provided during the exercise classes on June 11 (Group A starting from 09:45, Group B starting from 11:30).


## Happy coding! :computer::grimacing::sweat_drops::smile:
